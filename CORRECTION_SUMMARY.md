# Tax Calculation Correction Summary

## Date: October 19, 2025

## Issue Identified

The rebate calculation had a critical bug when no investment amount was provided:

### Previous (Incorrect) Logic:
```javascript
const rebate = Math.min(rebate3Percent, rebate15Percent, maxRebate);
```

When `investmentAmount = 0`:
- `rebate3Percent = taxableIncome × 3%` (e.g., 24,000 for 800k income)
- `rebate15Percent = 0 × 15% = 0`
- `maxRebate = 1,000,000`
- `selectedRebate = Math.min(24,000, 0, 1,000,000) = 0` ❌ **WRONG!**

This resulted in **zero rebate** when users didn't enter investment, which violates the tax rules.

## Authoritative Tax Rules (FY 2025-26)

According to Bangladesh income tax regulations:

> **Rebate = min(3% of TaxableIncome, 15% of ActualInvestment, BDT 1,000,000)**
> 
> **If user hasn't entered investment, rebate defaults to 3% of TaxableIncome (or zero if they opt out).**

## Corrected Logic

```javascript
function calculateRebate(taxableIncome, investmentAmount) {
    const rebate3Percent = taxableIncome * 0.03;
    const rebate15Percent = investmentAmount * 0.15;
    const maxRebate = 1000000;
    
    let selectedRebate;
    if (investmentAmount === 0) {
        // No investment provided: rebate defaults to 3% of taxable income (capped at max)
        selectedRebate = Math.min(rebate3Percent, maxRebate);
    } else {
        // Investment provided: minimum of all three
        selectedRebate = Math.min(rebate3Percent, rebate15Percent, maxRebate);
    }
    
    return {
        rebate3Percent,
        rebate15Percent,
        maxRebate,
        selectedRebate,
        investmentProvided: investmentAmount > 0
    };
}
```

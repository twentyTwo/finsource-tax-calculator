### Taxable Income

| 450,001 — 850,000 | 10% |
| 850,001 — 1,350,000 | 15% |
| 1,350,001 — 1,850,000 | 20% |
| 1,850,001 — 3,850,000 | 25% |
| 3,850,001 and above | 30% |

### Tax Rebate
- **Formula**: `min(3% of Taxable Income, 15% of Investment, BDT 1,000,000)`
- Minimum of three values is selected

### Final Calculations
